# Tor-Messenger-user.js

This will harden the Tor Messenger user.js for maximum possible security.


This is original released by CHEF-KOCH 2015 under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v2 license. 


Please note that the entire messenger is currently in beta, so everything can be changed with newer versions!


How can I access the about:config stuff under Tor Messenger?
-------------------

* Options - Advanced - General - 'Config Editor'
* The prefs.js is located under: ~\Tor Messenger\Messenger\TorMessenger\Data\Browser\profile.default\


Some security things are enabled, why?
-------------------

* Because I don't disable everything due the fact that to disable it have no real benefit except theoretically attacks. If you found real pages with attacks, report it to me and I will posible change that, but as long no one found any page / link which compromise the securty aspect within Tor Messenger I will not change that. I really don't a damn about theoretically pages which shows xyz possible attack which mostly requires Javascript and such enabled. 
* E.g. safebrowsing/cache/ssl reporting/javascript is enabled for several reasons.



Some options are removed will you add it?
-------------------

* No, my philosophy is to always use the latest software and use it with latest security options, so I won't look behind and add xyz config because someone want to use an outdated version. No, sorry at this point, your own your own if do so.
